= üìú About

This is my personal neovim config inspired by https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim[LazyVim], with KISS in mind.


== ‚ú® Features

- KISS: simple and stupid, less is better
- Easy: either to understand or to extend
- Fast: modern neovim config with pure lua
- Ready: comfortable and convenient out of the box


== üñºÔ∏è Effects

== ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Neovim >= *0.8.0* (needs to be built with *LuaJIT*)
- Git >= *2.19.0* (for partial clones support)
- a https://www.nerdfonts.com/[Nerd Font] *_(optional)_*
- a *C* compiler for `nvim-treesitter`. See https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#requirements[here]

- external tools (configured in `lua/init/options.lua:M.plugins`)
* treesitter parser: used by `nvim-treesitter`, install/update with `:TSUpdate`
* lsp server, linter, formatter: managed by `mason`, install/update with `:MasonUpdate`
* dap: external debug tools, install: `mason` or manually


== üöÄ Getting Started

[source,bash]
----
# backup your neovim config
mkdir -p nvim
mv ~/.config/nvim/ nvim/nv.config
mv ~/.local/share/nvim/ nvim/nv.share
mv ~/.local/state/nvim/ nvim/nv.state
mv ~/.cache/nvim/ nvim/nv.cache

# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/rtgiskard/lazyNvim.git ~/.config/nvim

# launch
nvim

# enter `Y` to install lazy.nvim and the plugins
----


== ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

`lua/init/options.lua`::
	most of neovim's options and some of the plugins' specs are configured here

`lua/init/keymaps.lua`::
	except for nvim and plugins' defaults, all manually configured keymaps are maintained here

`lua/plugins/`::
	define all the plugins managed by `lazy.nvim` with the spec settings

As this is not meant to be an all-in-one config for all dev languages, the initial setup includes
only a limited set that I personally use, you may want to adjust it as you need, like lsp servers
and formatters list in `lua/init/options.lua::plugins`, which should be enough.

Some of the settings are switchable via keymaps (like mouse, linenumber, listchars and etc.),
of course you can define more with the handlers held in `lua/init/utils.lua`.

And you may also find some references from https://www.lazyvim.org/[lazyVim's doc].


== üóíÔ∏è Plugin Notes

- `treesitter`: syntax parser, provide better highlighting
- `lsp`: language server, provide: completion, linting, formatting, diagnostics, hover/jump ..
- `linter`: common checks and provide hints, run with or without `lsp`
- `formatter`: format code, takes priority over `lsp` format
- `dap`: debug adapter

- related utils:
. `mason`: help to install lsp/dap/linter/formatter tools
. `lspconfig`: configurations for lsp servers

- ui enhancement:
. telescope: the extendable fuzzy finder
. notify: popup notification
. themes and misc

- other tools: complete, indent, trim, pairs, and etc.


== ‚úîÔ∏è Todo

- [ ] better DAP integration
- [ ] any recommendation?
